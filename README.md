- 👋 Hi, I’m @SolPyDev
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in all things coding. I particularly like HTML/CSS, Javascript, Python, and Solidity.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently a student at Nucamp, honing my skills in web dev (front and back end). Recently I've been studying cryptocurrency smart contracts in Solidity in my spare time.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone who has the same interests. I particularly love Python scripts and Solidity right now.

- 📫 Send me a message on Github!
